# Rust Yaar (יער)

*“Of all the trees we could've hit, we had to get one that hits back.” - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*

A collection of tree data structures implemented in Rust. These implementations have been written for
teaching and learning purposes. They have not been written for performance or extensibility.

Roadmap:

- [x] left-leaning red-black tree
- [ ] red-black tree
- [ ] avl tree
- [ ] b-tree
