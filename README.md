# Rust Yaar (יער)

*“Of all the trees we could've hit, we had to get one that hits back.” - Harry
Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*

A collection of tree data structures implemented in Rust. These implementations
have been written for teaching and learning purposes. They have not been written
for performance or extensibility.

Code is formatted using [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt).
Code is linted using [clippy](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy).

Roadmap:
- [ ] avl tree
- [ ] weak avl tree
